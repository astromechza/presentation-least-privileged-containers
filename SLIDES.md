## Why am I here

- I'm definitely on the developer side of things, but from a very full-stack/devops/SRE kind of team

- But with many interests in security topics,

    - Cryptographic systems
    - Process isolation
    - Least privileged applications
    - etc.

- People referenced various containerization things in one of the last OWASP meetups, so I thought I'd share some of the knowledge my team and I have picked up over time
